This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The buggy code attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range, leading to the exception. The fixed code corrects this by modifying the loop condition to prevent out-of-bounds access. This example highlights the importance of carefully managing array indices to avoid runtime errors.
